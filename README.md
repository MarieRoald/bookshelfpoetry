## What is a Bookshelf Poem?

This tool allows you to explore the collection of the National Library by assembling haiku-inspired poems from random book titles. The titles are selected such that the first verse will have five syllables, the second verse seven, and the third verse five.

Please note that syllable counts are estimated based on the number of vowels and may not always be accurate. For example, the estimate does not account for numbers or diphthongs.

The 'title poems' are also merely inspired by haiku structure and do not adhere to the rules of traditional haiku.
